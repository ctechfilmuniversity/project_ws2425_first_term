## Working Period

The official working period for the first term project is 06.01.-15.03.25. If you are sick within the official work period, you can get a deadline extension based on a doctor’s note (“Attest”). For that, you have to submit the Attest within the first three days of your sickness. We are not allowed to accept later than three days or any Attests in retrospect.

    * Software development
    * Hardware and pipeline development
    * Algorithms
    * Research / Experimentation
* System diagram
    * With which tech components are you working, and how are they connected?
* Minimal viable product
    * What is the smallest achievement you want to reach?
* Best-case scenario
    * What would you like to achieve if everything goes according to plan?
* Vision

Upload your project plan to this folder in a folder of your last name with the filename projectplan_lastname.md. You can also submit a document with a link to your personal repo.

For planning your project, take the evaluation criteria into consideration, e.g. we also evaluate your learning curve and experimental results.

### Final Project Submission

Deadline: 15.03.25, 23:59

    * You are free to design this page, it can also include a trailer, but you must cover the following points:
        * Title
        * Description of the content and its technical implementation
        * Context, related work
        * Your results
        * Discussion of your results
        * Next steps, future work
2. Project documentation

        * Software development
        * Hardware and pipeline development
        * Algorithms
        * Research / Experimentation
    * Reflection of technical choices
        * Why did you make the choice you made?
        * What worked well, what didn't?
        * What would you do differently next time?
    * Reflection on your Minimal viable product and Best-case scenario plans

3. Source files

    * Files can either be uploaded to this folder or you can provide a link to a different repo or online repository.
    * We will check your source files and project structure carefully. However, in most cases we will not attempt to build the project ourselves.

### Final Project Presentation

In April, everybody must present their results and project documentation. The presentation must be <= 20 min. There mustn't be any major changes to what was submitted in March. After each presentation, there will be time for questions and a discussion.


After the presentation, you must also submit the presentation slides and all used materials.   

## Grading

The grade is based on

* the submitted project plan
* the submitted project results and documentation
* the presentation

Please keep in mind that you should document your learning path and the execution of a plan continuously throughout the project. The documentation needs to cover the whole term, starting in November.
  
If you complete all other requirements but the final project submission, you can submit the project at a later time, but 15% of the final grade will be reduced. If you do not want a grade reduction for lateness or if you want to change the topic of your project one more time, you will need to re-do all steps for the 1st term project in the following year.

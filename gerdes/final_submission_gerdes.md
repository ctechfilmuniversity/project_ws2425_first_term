_Direct links to some distinct key requirements in the documentation. My development log functions as the work diary. Since my log is the centerpiece of the project website other aspects like context, related work or next steps can be found in there (eg. 'about liquid networks')_

_All source files for the main application can be found in my project repository. There is a separate training repository to replicate the model weights._

_To be able to build the project locally, the model files have to be downloaded separately and put into `./src-back/models` (dir has to be created as github doesn't support empty folders)_

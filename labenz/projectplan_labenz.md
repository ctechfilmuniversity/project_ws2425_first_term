## Description

![Regime Shift 1](./img/regime_shift_1.png)

Regime Shift is a survival-building game that presents players with a dual challenge: surviving in a living but fragile world and maintaining ecological balance. The game world is located on the inside of a hemisphere, whose balance is influenced by every action of the player.

The central element is a dynamic ecosystem, represented as interconnected resource fields on the playing field. Each field represents a part of the ecological cycle and transforms resources: forests absorb water and produce food, animals consume this and fertilize meadows, which in turn generate new resources. This continuous energy flow is the heart of the game. If one part of the system is overused – for example, through excessive deforestation – a resource bottleneck occurs (e.g., unused water), which endangers the balance of the hemisphere.

![Ecosystem](./img/regime_shift_2.png)

Players can fail in two ways: either through the tipping of the hemisphere when the ecosystem reaches its tipping point, or through failure to meet their own basic needs such as food and warmth. This duality forces a constant balancing act between resource use and system maintenance.

The game world is expected to be in a voxel style, with each voxel representing a specific resource with defined weight. A time management system provides additional dynamics: resources regenerate naturally while constructed structures decay. The use of non-sustainable resources like coal or iron enables faster progress but shifts the hemisphere's center of gravity upward and makes balancing more difficult.

For survival, players must construct basic structures: houses for protection from cold, cooking stations for food preparation, and workbenches for tools. Beyond this, they can also intervene in the ecosystem itself by building special structures:
To actively influence the ecosystem, players can construct special structures, such as aqueducts that transport excess water to dried-out areas and thus help preserve the hemisphere's balance.

These intervention possibilities allow players to act as active managers of the ecosystem and balance out inequalities. The game thus serves as an interactive metaphor for real ecological systems: excessive exploitation or uneven development leads to systemic problems that manifest in the physical inclination of the hemisphere. Players must learn to align their immediate needs with the long-term requirements of a stable ecosystem, acting as both users and guardians of the system.

These conceptual considerations form the current planning basis of the project but can be adjusted during development based on technical possibilities and playtesting results.

## Vision and Future Work

The main goal of the project is to develop a prototype and application documents for "Regime Shift" that serve as a basis for sponsorship applications. Successful submission to sponsors could create the financial basis for further development of the game. With additional funding, the game could be expanded beyond the initial prototype into a complete indie game.

## Challenge of your comfort zone

The challenge lies in developing a game without prior experience. With only limited prior knowledge in Unity, my task is not only to conceive innovative game mechanics but also to implement them technically. I must therefore learn technologies and development methods while realizing a complex game concept.

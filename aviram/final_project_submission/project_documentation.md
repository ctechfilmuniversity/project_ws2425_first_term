### **Work Diary & Temporary Results**

- Switched between multiple JS libraries (mostly Scrollama and Reach JS) before opting for a simpler approach using ScrollMagic JS and vanilla JS.
- Initially, my workflow was unorganized—I attempted to do everything simultaneously without clear steps. It took time to focus first on the design wireframe, then build the HTML, and finally work on JS. Establishing these steps made the process clearer, proving that working slowly and methodically leads to better results and greater satisfaction.
- Faced difficulties with React due to lack of frequent practice.
- Successfully implemented the first interactive section.

### **Categories in My Results**

- **Creative / Artistic Development:**
  - Custom illustrations exported as .PNG for the scroll animation.
  - British vintage Middle Eastern colonial-style layout design.

- **Narrative Development:**  
  - Initially, I explored nature as an analogy for the Israeli conflict.
  - After researching different themes (bird migration, invasive species, drying up of the Dead Sea), I found the Eucalyptus story to be an interesting metaphor for the early 20th-century Israeli narratives.
  - I discovered an existing article that inspired the story, fully edited, and adapted its structure for the interactive experience.
  - Using an existing article aligns with the concept of applying this technique in online magazines.

- **Audio-Visual Design:**
  - Planned visual storytelling elements include animations, transitions, and audio.
  - An Israeli [1950s song about the Eucalyptus fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awOALvb2scA) will be integrated as part of the experience.

- **Software Development:**
  - After experimenting with multiple libraries, I decided on a combination of basic JavaScript, Scrollama JS, HTML, CSS, and a local server setup in VS Code.

- **Research / Experimentation:**
  - Conducted visual research to define the aesthetic, settling on a British colonial-era Middle East style.
  - Refined the story selection to effectively convey the project’s main idea while ensuring it remains visually engaging and personally inspiring.
  - Explored various frameworks and scrollytelling methods before choosing the final implementation.

### **Reflection on Technical Choices**

- **Why?** React was too complex given my current skills and project constraints.
- **What worked?** Using straightforward JavaScript allowed for steady progress.
- **What didn’t?** AI tools were not applicable due to the project’s unique design.
- **Next time?** Start with a simpler approach and scale up as needed.

### **Reflection on MVP vs. Best-Case Scenario**

- **Achieved:** A functional prototype with one interactive section. While this is closer to the “worst-case scenario,” much of the time was spent refining my workflow. These new insights make me excited to continue working toward the best-case outcome.
- **Not achieved:** Full project completion due to technical challenges.
- **Why?** I underestimated the difficulty of developing a React JS page after a long break from using it.

### **Challenges & Learning**

Developing an interactive storytelling experience from scratch was challenging. The interactivity I envisioned required custom code, and my lack of recent experience with React made the process exhausting.

Additionally, building this project without a structured workflow was difficult. My past projects relied on freeform coding, but this approach proved ineffective here. Perhaps I’ve grown as a developer and now need a more structured approach. 

When coding became frustrating, shifting focus to design—where I felt more confident—helped me stay motivated. A colleague advised me to design everything first, then build only the HTML before diving into JavaScript. This step-by-step method, while obvious to some, was a revelation for me and helped reignite my motivation.

Another challenge was deciding between writing “beautiful, state-of-the-art” code and simply getting things done. Initially, I believed impressive code quality was essential for success. However, conversations with developers, classmates, and my advisor helped me realize that the end result matters more than perfection in the code itself. You can’t achieve great results without first producing and learning from imperfect work. Choosing a more straightforward coding method kept me moving forward.

Balancing creativity with technical execution was also key. I read that coding skills fade quickly without practice, more than other skills. I had to accept that I am not as strong a developer as I once was, but that’s okay—my current focus is on the creative aspects of this project. With AI’s growing role in development, understanding code may be more important than manually writing it.

### **Reflection on the Original Work Plan**

I didn’t follow my original plan as expected, likely due to personal issues and confusion. This project has gone through multiple iterations, and I previously abandoned two earlier versions. The mental effort of finishing it was as difficult as the coding itself. However, I now have a clear path forward and am excited to continue working on it next semester. :D

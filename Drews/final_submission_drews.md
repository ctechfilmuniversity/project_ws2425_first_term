# Final Project Submission

You can access my final project from my GitHub repository https://github.com/imogendrews/bais_orientation_project. To run this project, look at the file TheDefault.md. 

You can then look at the data I generated in the github repository https://github.com/imogendrews/bias_project_data. This script is not meant to be run, I added this to explain how I went about generating captions and analysing the data.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This is a basic intro to multimedia scrollytelling that demonstrates
        scrollytelling techniques for use by Javascript novices. Templates
        adapted from

          >Russel Goldenberg's templates.</a

        Examples all use media from environmental activist Mina Guli's #runblue
        campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by planning your story. Choose the visuals first and then
        <a
          href="https://www.slideshare.net/AdamWestbrook/writing-to-pictures-the-basics"
          >write to picture</a
        >. If you don't have final media available yet, use placeholders and
        sketches for your planning. Always test, review and revise the text
        again once you have the final version of your media available. Keep your
        text simple and short. Test the experience of reading while scrolling on
        different screen sizes.
      </p>
      <p>Decide what the media (image or video) is doing in the story.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Informational</em> (foreground image or chart, usually captioned)
          - This should add information to your story, it would usually be
          captioned. Instead of developing a very complex chart or diagram,
          consider exporting the image or chart in different stages or versions
          to accompany step-by-step textual commentary. This should help the
          reader understand a complex process or chart by seeing it evolve as
          they scroll through your textual explanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Narrative</em> (foreground image or video, probably captioned) -
          This tells a story either using a video or a still image with a strong
          implied narrative. Add your scrolling text much as you would write a
          script for narrative in a documentary - by
          <a
            href="https://www.slideshare.net/AdamWestbrook/writing-to-pictures-the-basics"
            >writing to picture</a
          >. Ensure that all important narrative details are legible in both
          text and visuals. The user should be able to control video - play,
          pause buttons etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Atmospheric</em> (background audio, video or image) - Avoid using
          autoplay for audio - rather allow the user to switch it on. If you use
          a background video or image, this should not interfere with the
          legibility of the text, but can be used creatively to hint at
          narrative, foreshadow, flash back, highlight specific details etc.
          Consider reducing contrast, or upping brightness to improve
          legibility. Background video does not need a full set of controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Optional</em> (e.g. user scrolls through a selection of short
          audio clips) - You should be able to adapt the basic pattern of visual
          scrollytelling to allow the user to navigate through a set of audio
          clips e.g. by selecting different episodes / sections of a podcast or
          scrolling to “meet” different participants in a vox pop. Scrolling is
          usually a primarily visual interaction, so combine the audio clips
          with suitable still images for best effect. As there is no visual cue
          when a new audio file loads you will definitely need to add captions
          or even add a background colour change so that the user can see there
          has been a change in the audio.

        templates (currently somewhat under construction).

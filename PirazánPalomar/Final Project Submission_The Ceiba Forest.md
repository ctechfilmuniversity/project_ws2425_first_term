### **DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENT AND ITS TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**
![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/81bdaf71bee2c5bb2de40b6da8270b84b8c4808b/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/19_INstallation.png)

This installation recreates a forest in the middle of Amazonas, where the Ceiba is the central being of that ecosystem. The installation displays a tropical rainforest located indoors with only one big central Ceiba tree and surrounding screens that will become more important as the experience progresses. In general terms the venue will smell and sound like a rainforest that will match with the light design of the space according to the narrative of the experience. At the beginning the central Ceiba is in a dry forest. The drought will diminish and the tree will start reviving as soon as the audience enters the ecosystem, since they will be the water and the nutrients that the tree needs to survive and start growing, blooming and being the shelter of animals, plants and allow the regeneration of the ecosystem again. Only by the action of the audience the artwork will reveal itself and the forest will start healing again. When the ecosystem has enough water and nutrients again, it can even store water in its trunk and that will be the end of the experience. 

The audience is clearly a character with impact on the experience. And the experience will have 3 successive main stages that will gradually evolve:

![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/81bdaf71bee2c5bb2de40b6da8270b84b8c4808b/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/21_Videoinstallation.png)

1. **The dry forest:** The beginning of the experience, everything is dark, the color palette is black, gray and beige, the colors do not have much saturation or brightness. The floor will look dry. When walking on the space the sounds of the footsteps of the audience will be the same as when something wet comes in contact with something very hot mixed with trampled dry leaves and breaking branches. The sounds of the space will be only wind and when touching the trunk, this will emit a hollow sound, since there is nothing inside. Visually the space will be mostly dark and the trunk will not show signs of life. 

2. **The regeneration phase:** Starting from the ground (the floor, the roots and the base of the trunk) up to the canopy of the tree, the tree and the surrounding screens will start to light up by the means of translating the movement of the audience into a more vivid environment rich in color and sound, representing the revival of the Ceiba. The trunk will have the typical vertically crisscrossed light green lines of the Ceiba, which will be recreated with lights that will flow (light up) according to the interaction of the audience with the installation. The sound will include water flowing through the space, the footsteps will sound like when one is in mud, a little rain may be heard, along with some  animals that start to get closer to the environment. When touching the trunk or getting closer to it, it will sound like a flow that comes from the inside of it. 

3. **The Ceiba forest:** The audience, i. e. the water will have such a positive effect in the environment, that the internal flow of the water will be louder, the footsteps will sound like stepping in puddles, some heavy rains will also be part of the sound design along with closer and louder animal sounds. Since this tree has the ability of storing water in its trunk, the sound of the hollowness of the beginning will be completely replaced by fullness at this point. Visually the screens around the place, that will be so tall as the tree, will show the rainforest around, full of other Ceibas, along with other species of plants, trees and animals. 

### **CONTEXT, RELATED WORK**
* **PERSONAL MOTIVATION**:
The Ceiba tree (Kapok tree) is a magnificent species originated in pre-Hispanic Latin America and present in different parts of the world which existence is of big benefit not only for itself, but also to other species and the ecosystem itself. It is a great example and inspiration for us humans on how to interact with our environment in a constructive way, rather than in a destructive one, as it is unfortunately the case until today. The Ceiba has helped its ecosystem, but now we are the ones who have to help the Ceiba to survive, since the rainforests are facing increasingly extreme droughts and uncontrollable forest fires. I am convinced that the installation experience can raise awareness on this issue and can be a call to action. 

* **ABOUT THE CEIBA:**

    The Ceiba tree is on of the biggest trees in the tropical forests, it can be up to 75m tall. 

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/d9b578a8e9e0254692ac6a65444e53c98fbcc417/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/01_Ceiba.jpg)

    It is classified as pantropical, that means that is it present not only in the Americas, the continent I come from, but also in Africa and Asia. It is present in forest and in the jungle from Mexico to the south of the well known Amazonas region.

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/d9b578a8e9e0254692ac6a65444e53c98fbcc417/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/02_Ceiba%20Karte.png)

    It offers shelter thanks to the big shadow produced by its foliage and it provides food to bats, opossums, nocturnal monkeys, hummingbirds and moths thanks to its nectar filled flowers. 

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/e5292365603c3c8d05018556f8664b7c9bc3c5bf/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/03_Flowers1.jpg)

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/e5292365603c3c8d05018556f8664b7c9bc3c5bf/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/04_Flowers2.jpg)

    Ceibas can store water in its trunk when the terrain is very wet. This water can be used later during the dry seasons by the Ceiba or shared with other surrounding trees. 

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/847939b9dd4b6f99aa04bd44e107424e080f53ca/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/05_Ceiba%20trunk.png)

    Moreover, this giant offers a soft cotton fiber, which cover the seeds of the tree, can travel long distances spreading the seed through air and can be used for other purposes like the fillings of the pillows. (See the picture below)

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/847939b9dd4b6f99aa04bd44e107424e080f53ca/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/06_Seeds%2Bcotton.jpg)

    This is how an old Ceiba looks like: 

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/847939b9dd4b6f99aa04bd44e107424e080f53ca/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/07_Ceiba.jpg)

    All this characteristics have not been overlooked by indigenous peoples like Mayas and Ticunas. The former thought that due to the long roots of the tree and the branches, the tree was able to connect the underworld, the earth and the sky, shaping the world. Life then, flows world through this tree and its eradication would only mean the eradication of the world itself. The latter said that the end of the darkness of the world and the origin of the biggest river of Colombia, the Magdalena river, was the result of the felling of a big ceiba, which had plunged the world into thick darkness. This was possible thanks to two heroes: Yoi and Ipi together with the animals of the jungle.  Thus, the Ceiba is the origin of life and sacred being that keeps the world in order and balance.

* **RELATED ARTISTS AND ARTWORKS:**

   _**“La Ceiba Inflatable Tree Installation”**_, made my _Martin Wannam_ (Guatemala) is an artwork that mixed the symbol of resilience of the tree and the joy and celebration of being immigrant and queer in order to strengthen the community through the joy and colorfuness of the inflatable in North Calorine in the frame of the festival “La fiesta del pueblo” (The festival of the people)

   ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7bce48d82226b5dd4f6ecaabcc6c62138b64992f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/09_GUatemala.png)

    _**“Tree of life”**_ by _Ilusionist digital arts studio._ Antalya Diplomacy Forum 2022. This work is a more abstract approach to the idea of the tree as a central part of the installation.
    
    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7bce48d82226b5dd4f6ecaabcc6c62138b64992f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/10_TUrkey.png)

    _**“Light Harps”**_ is an installation where a piano was made with lasers that get activated to the touch. _Jen Lewin_ is an US-American artist and engineer who works with light, sound and public interactive art. I really like this work, since people can play music together by touching the lasers. This is a reference for the interactivity part of my project.
    
    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7bce48d82226b5dd4f6ecaabcc6c62138b64992f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/11_Light%20harp.png)
    
    Another example for interactivity is _**"Pulse room"**_, made by _Rafael Lozano-Hemmer_. The entire room full with light bulbs that flash as the exact rhythm of the participants pulse/heart using a sensor. 

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7bce48d82226b5dd4f6ecaabcc6c62138b64992f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/17_Rafael.png)    

    _**“Sanctuary of the Unseen Forest”**_  it is a video installation made by _Marshmallow Laser Feast (MLF)._ This project shows a digital representation of the Ceiba in the Colombian rainforest. It aims to see beyond the human senses in order to be able to observe and be conscious about the way everything is connected and how life resides inside plants from a sacred and contemplative perspective. It was made with Lidar scanning & Photogrammetry Processes.

    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7bce48d82226b5dd4f6ecaabcc6c62138b64992f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/12_Ceiba%20.png)
    
    ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7bce48d82226b5dd4f6ecaabcc6c62138b64992f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/13_Ceiba.png)

    _**“Breathing with the forest”**_, also from _Marshmallow Laser Feast (MLF)_, is another contemplation project of the colombian Amazonas. This team gather volumetric data and ambisonic field recordings as part of a digital preservation process for endangered ecosystems and the species of fragile biomes, as they define them. It was also made with the help of Lidar scanning & Photogrammetry Processes.

     ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7bce48d82226b5dd4f6ecaabcc6c62138b64992f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/14_Amazonas.png)

     Another interesting example made by  _MLF_ is the project _**“Forest Bathing: Lupuna”**_, commissioned by the _Thermengruppe Josef Wund_; where the audiovisual installative experience meets nature through wellness. The audiovisual material was made thanks to the use of Lidar scanning & Photogrammetry Processes.

     Going deeper into the experimental side of the audiovisual I want to mention the work of _BIll Viola_, particularly the video _**"The reflecting pool"**_, because it makes me think about the potential of the audiovisual not only as a documentation of the concrete world, but rather as a wiggle room where the visible, the invisible, the synchronism and asynchronism coexist. 

     [![Rolf Lauter: Bill Viola: The Reflecting Pool, 1979. Lecture Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt 1994](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CSEkrV2TLs8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSEkrV2TLs8 "Rolf Lauter: Bill Viola: The Reflecting Pool, 1979. Lecture Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt 1994")

     Another artwork from _Viola_ is the work _**"Martyrs (Earth, Air, Fire, Water)"**_ where the relationship of the human with the non - human nature is displayed. I like this work because it uses the high quality recordings as a poetic medium that speaks about the tension between life and death. 
     
    [![Bill Viola – Martyrs (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) | TateShots](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kYay_DDL3eA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYay_DDL3eA "Bill Viola – Martyrs (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) | TateShots")

     There is another work of _Viola_ that is very close to my idea of the Ceiba forest. It is an interactive installation with a tree as protagonist. It is called _**"The tree of knowledge"**_ and it changes stronger with the proximity of the audience. 
     
    [![The tree of knowledge](https://img.youtube.com/vi/9NdVMtod3vg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NdVMtod3vg "The tree of knowledge")

    Another inspirational artist is without doubt _Agnes Denes_ called **_"Tree mountain - A living time Capsule - 11,000 Trees, 11,000 People, 400 years."_**. This is a living artwork where real trees were planted on the site of an abandoned mine to be preserved for future generations. [Here](http://www.agnesdenesstudio.com/works4.html) you can visit the artist website for more details. We can definitely create artworks that have a direct positive impact on the world we live in. Every person who planted a tree has a responsibility to take care of it and this responsibility goes to their descendants through generations. 

    ![image alt](https://artwork.earth/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Denes-Agnes_Tree-Mountain_1.jpg)  

    _Olafur Eliasson_ **_"Beauty"_** 1993 displays a rainbow inside the TATE modern. The use of the natural element in the museum is something I really enjoy. 

     [![Olafur Eliasson 'Beauty' 1993](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BeSlK0RvHd0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeSlK0RvHd0 "Olafur Eliasson 'Beauty' 1993")

     Another work of _Eliasson_ that I like is _**"Waterfall"**_. It was presented in New York 2008 and in Versailles 2016. Again, the natural elements as past of the installations is something that I feel passionate about.

    Thinking about my south american roots and my migration background as a student and artist I find the work of _Ana Mendieta_ very important. She was a cuban - US american woman, who lived in the States due to a exile program that found place in her hometown. She explored the pain of being placed in other part of the world far away from her roots. Her _**"Silueta Series"**_ made in Mexico in the 70's was a way of question herself about her identity, her presence in the world and as a way of healing and reconnecting with the nature, since she felt as if she had been expelled from her womb, from her native land.  This cideo explains a little bit about it: 

    [![Object Lesson: Alia Farid on Ana Mendieta](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OvkM3KPwSWM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvkM3KPwSWM "Object Lesson: Alia Farid on Ana Mendieta")

    Some references for sound are: 
    _John Cage_ famous work of 1962 _**"4'33"**_ The following video is a performance of this piece and I really appreciate the way in which the limits between life and art, specially music in this work do not exist and for me it is an invitation to listen to the music that is around us.
  
    [![John Cage's 4'33"](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JTEFKFiXSx4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4 "John Cage's 4'33")
    

    Other works of _Cage_ "_ defined as **Chance operations**_" apply the indeterminacy, change ans decision as part of the composition of the music piece. I definitely apply that in my installation in order so it has a living quality. 

    _Cage_ made a work called _**"Branches"**_ in 1976. It is an extension of his work "Child Of Tree" of 1975. It is a chance composition for amplified cactus, performed by the 7-piece daswirdas ensemble inside the echoic chambers of a huge Swiss dam. This is a video with the performance. I find very nice how the nature is also part of the composition. This is a video with a contemporary performance:
    [!["John Cage - Branches"](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YzyR4dwBp90/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzyR4dwBp90 "John Cage - Branches")
   
    Similar to Cage's work, _Karlheinz Stockhausen_ made a work called _**" Herbstmusik"**_. This is a contemporary performance. It uses daily life elements as part of the composition:
  
     [!["KARLHEINZ STOCKHAUSEN Herbstmusik"](https://img.youtube.com/vi/TuKqqmwygEc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuKqqmwygEc "KARLHEINZ STOCKHAUSEN Herbstmusik")

     From this artist I emphasize his different explorations in order to question and go beyond the traditional ways of composing a playing music. I have read about his theories: the polyvalent form, the variable form,  subjective durational structures, the open form and the ways in which music can be dynamic when they are based on the different possibilities of the composition or the interpretation. I like this lively quality of the sound. 

     Finally, I got inspiration from a [website](https://pippinbarr.com/) that showcases games made by artist, who defy the traditional ways of playing and interacting. It is called _**"Pippin Barr"**_. 
    

### **YOUR RESULTS** 
I developed an interactive audiovisual system with sensors and hand recognition. In order to do it I worked on the concept of the interaction and the technical system to make it possible, which includes the software and hardware. The full display of my results will be presented on April of the present year in the form of a prototype of the interaction system, taking into account that it is the best way of showcasing the system and receive feedback. 

**CONCEPT OF THE INTERACTIVE SYSTEM:**
The audiovisual design is based on the fact that the trees depend on the water flow to live and that the trees communicate with each other not only in the soil through the network of fungi and microorganisms, but also through the emission of chemical substances into the wind. As a result the installation will have 3 systems:

- A "**water system**": It is an exploration of the physical gesture of the audience in order to influence the ecosystem. This exploration uses a web cam and the audience will need to move their hands to "provide water to the tree". It is based in this video: 
[![" Hand Pose Detection with ml5.js "](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vfNHdVbE-l4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfNHdVbE-l4 " Hand Pose Detection with ml5.js"). 

- A "**soil system**": It will be on the floor and it will be made based on the method explained in this video about a DIY capacitive touch sensor that will trigger randomly sounds according to every stage of the installation (dry forest, regeneration phase and ceiba forest): 
[!["How to make a capacitive touch sensor switch out of anything metal using an Arduino"](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lqg_Ze_OiiY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqg_Ze_OiiY "How to make a capacitive touch sensor switch out of anything metal using an Arduino")

    There will be different sensors on the floor of the installation space and the audience will trigger the sound when walking on the different sensors. This system can only play a defined group of sounds in every stage of the installation, but for now the transition needs to be done manually.

- An "**air system:**": In contrast to the two previous systems, this one allows to see a progressive transition that depends on the proximity of the audience to the sensor and is reflected in the sounds and visuals. The three stages of the installation are then displayed as follows: when the audience get closer to the system (the forest) they bring life to it. This is represented in greener colors of the botanic visuals and the higher volume of sounds of water and animals. In contrast to that closeness, the remoteness of the audience is represented by a desertic sound environment and the lack of saturation, brightness and hue of the visuals. This was my final project for CC1 and the result is have 2 sketches to show:

    1. **_CC1_Final_Barnsley Fern_**: is based on the mathematical analysis of natural forms. I followed a tutorial to do it, as you will see on the "Work diary" section, but I personalized the code to adapt it to my project and make it interactive. I really love the way the fern can both:

    * Desintegrate in the dark when the audience is far away and how the sound is desertic and noisy.

         &
    * Bloom and come to live together with vivid sounds of water an animals when the audience come closer.

        I believe this is the poetic part of the work I have been looking for, because the distance between humans and non - human, even though we are of course part of the nature needs to be questioned because coming closer to it can get it out of the dark, both figurative and literal. 

         Here is a screenshot:

        ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/489a021e4538fc3b338264407f4c56b6d03ae70f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/12_CC1_Final.png)

         & here is a video:
      
        [![CC1_Final_Barnsley Fern](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vKJ8XwXGoZY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJ8XwXGoZY "CC1_Final_Barnsley Fern")

    2. **_CC1_Final_Phyllotaxis_**: is also based on the mathematical analysis of natural forms. Phyllotaxis is an spiral based arrangement of leaves on a plant stem. I followed a tutorial to do it too, as you will see on the "Learnings" section, but I personalized this code to adapt it to my project and make it interactive. I worked with the same sound system and sounds, but visually this approach is different from the previous one, because the proximity of the audience does not affect the "existence" (desintegration or blooming) of the pattern, but the saturation, brightness and hue of the pattern being drawn changes.

        Here is a screenshot:

        ![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/489a021e4538fc3b338264407f4c56b6d03ae70f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/11_CC1_Final.png)

        & here is a video:

### **DISCUSSION OF YOUR RESULTS** 
_The Ceiba forest_ is a group of 3 systems that are related but not completely integrated. I have already accomplished to use the sensor readings and the hand detection as a way of transmitting the audience that when they interact with the artwork, it blooms and it displays itself. I am very proud of achieving not only an interaction with sound but also with the visual component. I have found that the forest has invisible and inaudible dynamics I can get inspiration from in order to create a visible and audible experience. This ecological approach can offer us a way of pushing the boundaries of audiovisuals and the way we interact and communicate with our environment to create new narratives and aesthetics.

This prototype is a first approach to an audiovisual proposal where the marginality and hierarchy with an interconnected system where everything is equally relevant and interdependent is reinforced by this narrative and aesthetic dynamic, where the public will play an active role in changing the state of the given circumstances. I have identified the chance as an essential way of creating a living experience that is unique because of the randomness of the system and the conjugation of that randomness with the triggers generated by the audience's action. 


### **NEXT STEPS, FUTURE WORK** 
First of all I want to integrate the 3 systems and include the elements I wanted to have in my best-case scenario: the light design and the scenography. I can visualize a fourth system where plants could have microphones that could be triggered by the public to influence the sound landscape of the installation. 

I have been thinking about the movement of the audience through the space and the concept of migration and the drawing of cartographies in the installation space that could be used for drawing botanical visuals associated to that movement in space. Furthermore I would like to include sound synthesis and concrete music to enrich the experience. 

Another aspect I think it could be complementary to the artwork would be the exploration of gamification and narration dynamics that could enhance the interactive character of the storytelling of the experience through the ways of interaction like the pose recognition or the use of Kinect and the voices of the forest in different languages. 

    
## **PROJECT DOCUMENTATION**

### **WORK DIARY WITH TEMPORARY RESULTS AND FAILURE CASES**

I feel very comfortable discovering my own path. That means I normally create an open space and dedicate time to different topics that are part of the constellation of the project. I see the artwork as a process and a destination at the same time. The complex connections between technology, nature, interaction and art of _**Ceiba Forest**_ are the result of a series of iterations in 2 areas. Since this iterations do not occur following a rigorous plan but within a framework, I will write on this document my path on my way to create the artwork. Every time I work on something I will record it in the form of a log, which will allow me to understand and to feel the artwork and decide the direction of the process. 

The 2 iteration processes are: Forest nature and p5 + Arduino + Body recognition. 

---

### **FIRST ITERATION - FOREST NATURE** 

This is the second category of iterations. Ii is meant to provide me with a broader and deeper understanding of the ecosystem that is inspiring my artwork. I am speacially interested in understanding better the ways the trees communicate to each other and how they interact with the water, in order to get some inspiration for the technical sensorial system I am working on. 

1.  "**DAS WALDBUCH: ALLES, WAS MAN WISSEN MUSS, IN 50 GRAPHIKEN**" by _Esther Gonstalla_.
    ![alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/pim-red/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_580,q_auto,w_580,f_auto/v1617238801/oekom/cover/9783962382117_cmyk.jpg)

    It was published in 2021 by the oeoekom verlag München and it has great information about this topic. I will now share some facts I found in the book that I think are relevant:

    **LOCATION AND TYPES OF FOREST**
    There are 2 forest belts: 

    * The tropical rainforest
      
    ![alt text](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/img/biome/map-rainforest-manaus.png)

    - & the boreal coniferous forest:
    
    ![alt text](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/img/biome/map-coniferous.jpg)

    Additionally we will find green trees around the world in the summer seasons as we know. However, in the tropics there are no seasons and the trees are growing non stop thanks to the constant presence of sun and rain. Therefore, flowers and fruits are constantly growing when the humans and their actions do not interfere with or affect the ecosystem. 50% of the types of plants are located in this ecosystem and 45% of the forest of the world are in this tropical landscapes. It is also in the tropics where we will find greater biodiversity and different types of plants, fungi and animals.

    The forest transform the CO2 into oxygen and this is also important for the regional regulation of the climate change. In other words, they are vital to ensure life and balance on the planet. The network of roots of the trees strengthen the soil, protecting it from erosion during heavy rains or storms. The existence of forest increases water availability and security forall beings. The forest bring food and have for many indigenous groups a cultural and spiritual functions. 


    **THE NATURE OF TREES:**
    * **Nutrition:** The sources are solar energy, CO2, water, sugar and dissolved mineral nutrients from the soil. When they are in a vegetation period they need loads of water. 

    * **Photosynthesis:** Trees transform the CO2 into sugar with the help of the solar energy and liberate oxygen in the process. Trees can store big quantities of CO2. However, trees and microorganisms liberate CO2 as a result of respiration processes on the soil, but of course the proportion of the liberated CO2 is much less as the CO2 that is stored. 

    * **Surviving winter:** (For trees in countries with seasons) trees can survive winter by storing sugars as antifreeze, using abundant water transport and photosynthesis, and extracting the last nutrients from the leaves before they fall to the ground. Once the leaves are on the ground they are slowly composted with the help of soil organisms such as fungi, so the roots can absorb their remaining nutrients.

    * **Communication:** The wood wide web is the interconnection and communication system of the trees. It consist of the symbiosis with fungi and microorganisms. In a piece of woodland the oldest trees are the ones that are most intensively networked. Different types of fungi weave around the fine roots and can spread for kilometers. They help the roots to absorb nutrients and water and receive sugar from the photosynthesis in exchange. In case of a stressful situations like the lack of water or nutrients of a tree the fungi signal the situation through the fungal network so that the missing elements like enzymes and nutrients can be sent to the tree that has these deficiencies from other trees.

        It is also very impressive that trees communicate across species not only below ground but also above ground by emitting chemical substances, for example when there is danger from insects. There is another phenomena that occurs naturally among trees called "self-thinning" when there is no enough water, room, light or nutrients for all trees in a forest, the tree density decreases, so the amount available nutrients, water, light and space are enough for the remaining trees so their ability to grow and defend themselves improves. This is also the result of a competition for those primary resources. The dead trees on the other hand have a nutrient supply that migrates to surrounding trees through the fungal network.   

    * **The forest and the water:** When water catchment areas are forested, the availability and quality of the water increases. The influence of humans in the forest reduce their natural capacity of storing, filtering and enriching with minerals the water, that is our drinking water supply. 
        
    I found very impressive that 70% of the precipitation in a forest returns to the atmosphere and that the rain that falls falls on the leaves and pines is first stored in the crown of the trees and only after being full it filters the water into the soil and it is absorbed by the roots or goes to the groundwater. The transpiration of the absorbed water occurs through the crown of the trees and only a small portion of that transpiration occurs on the soil.  

    75% of the drinking water in the world comes from a forested water catchment area. 

    * **Soil:** When the soil is wet the temperatures are not that high, the winds are gentil, the forest is humid and there is more rain. On the other hand the dry soil is related with stronger winds, higher temperatures and less humidity and rain. 

    * **Dead trees:** The dead wood is important to the balance of the ecosystem, because there around 1200 different types of fungi responsible for the nutrient circulation in the forest. Another interesting fact is that around 50% of the spruces grow on rotten wood in mountain forests. A lot of insects contribute to the decomposition of wood and are at the same time a food source for birds, reptiles and other animals. Reptiles and amphibians ise the hollow trunks for overwintering. Even wild bees use the dead wood for laying eggs and vespers use it for overwintering. It is an important habitat and food source for animals and plants that work together in many ways to break down the wood. 


        
    **THE FOREST AND THE CLIMATE:**
    The relationship of the forest with the climate is relevant to understand the cause - effect dynamics that prevails. Now I will describe the aspects of this relationship that I find important for the video installation. 

    * The diversity of species has decreased 60% in the las 40 years due to human intervention, even though 70% of our food depends on pollination by bees and other insects, whose lives and diversity are endangered and which have a direct effect on human food production.  

    * Another important aspect regarding the death of the trees is that the CO2 cycle is affected by the increasing droughts, because with the decrease of forests there are no more subway water reserves, there is no rainfall, leaves fall, photosynthesis does not occur, but on the contrary, fallen leaves and trees without leaves release CO2, aggravating the climatic situation.

    * The global warming global decreases soil moisture and young trees do not survive, as they do not have enough water within reach and their roots are too short to reach the groundwater to drink.

2. **"102 GRÜNE KARTEN ZUR RETTUNG DER WELT"**

    ![alt text](https://media.suhrkamp.de/mediadelivery/rendition/5f6a5648d5fb493195328fe2740f323d/-B2160/102-gruene-karten-zur-rettung-der-welt_9783518470831_cover.jpg)

    I also read this book. It has an ironic and comedy tone that makes the reading enjoyable, even when the topics are over and over again pointing at our human responsibility, which can be hard for denialist of climate change. This book and the first one have in common the good use of the graphic design as an extension of the arts to raise awareness and educate the audiences, taking into account that we live ina world where the audiovisual information is nowadays part of written information. 

    This is an example of the tone of the book: 
    ![alt text](https://media.suhrkamp.de/mediadelivery/rendition/c71adf7456cb471994e9a459841179ab/-B2160/102-gruene-karten-zur-rettung-der-welt_9783518470831_innenabbildung.jpg)

    * It is refreshing that the books shares useful information about the unfortunately very human relationship with the nature that can be inspiring and/or trigger a painful guilt. But of course is nothing compared to the damage we do to our ecosystems. 

    * I also learned about a very interesting project made by _Topher White_ with old cell phones to identify and stop the deforestation in real time:
   
       [![TEDx How We Can Protect Rainforests Around the World-Topher White (2014)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wKgedT0ozME/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKgedT0ozME "TEDx How We Can Protect Rainforests Around the World-Topher White (2014)")

        Next, I want to share some part of the book that inspired me:

   3. **BIOSPHÄRE POTSDAM**
    I went to the Biosphäre Potsdam, because I read that there ir a Ceiba tree there, so I wanted to see it with my own eyes. It costs 14€ for students and it is a very nice place with a lot of animals, plants and trees. Due to the humidity I felt like in the colombian tropical forest. Here there is a video about my journey:

        [![Biosphäre Potsdam](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rVfLPgI_nfE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVfLPgI_nfE "Biosphäre Potsdam")

         Visiting this place was very important for me in order to get a more physical approach to the project. Of course the technical and the theoretical approaches are very important to find the structure of the project. However, since I am designing an experience these encounters with nature are very important for me in order to discover how is my perception of these ecosystems and to decide how to create this installation. In order to create such an experience, I had to identify which are my subjective interpretations of nature and which elements of the installation can help to convey the idea of a dead forest coming back to life through the influence of the audience.

        For me the forest is a system where the balance is the result of a complex network. When the balance is affected by human action the soil, the plants, the animals and the water are no longer present in the ecosystem in the same quality or quantity. Some persons could love the dry ecosystems while other could love the rainy ecosystems, but the fact is that the ecosystem of the ceiba should not depend on what we humans prefer, but on what is better for the ceiba. 

        The Biosphäre was a very nice experience because it made me think of the migration of the flora and fauna species. The preservation of life needs to be aware of the needs of the species and we could extrapolate that to humans and the ways in which we decide politically to preserve life in all its forms. The ceiba that is visible on the video at the beginning did not have any signs to identify it, but I could easily find it thanks to its height. I was amazed about how the tree was surrounded by different species and how even when I am interested in the ceiba, it is part of a bigger system that is definitely bigger and more complex as the tree alone. 

        Particularly sad is that this beautiful space is in danger of disappearing due to the lack of financial support [Here](https://www.openpetition.de/petition/online/sichert-die-zukunft-der-biosphaere-potsdam-der-ort-fuer-bildung-wissenschaft-und-nachhaltigkeit) is a link with a petition to preserve this space.

### **SECOND ITERATION - p5 + Arduino + Body recognition:**
This is definitely a more technical approach. I will start by learning more about p5 and Arduino, since it is the way I have found to work on the interaction. Coding with JavaScript will allow me to feel more confident and together with Arduino, it will bring me closer to know the creative possibilities of this software-hardware combination. 

* I saw [this series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) of 36 video tutorials about p5 to understand better. It was made by _"The coding train"_ and it has helped me to improve my skills with Javascript. Here is a screenshot:

    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/949900cd5b3fdd735b38c19ce2e8f020cb52416f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/01_Coding%20train.png)

    I learned about syntax, functions, variables, boolean expressions, control structures like conditional statements, nested loops, classes, arrays, load data and object communication. This was very useful to have a better picture of the way it works and to find new possibilities for my project. 

* After this I wanted to focus on sound, so I saw a [second series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFcVjlDAkkGIixw70s7jpW) of 11 video tutorials, also made  by _"The coding train"_. Here is a screenshot: 

    ![alt image](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/aff373aa27146965e16c64b23d52ef9faaa7578e/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/02_Coding%20train_sound.png)

    I learned about loading sounds, creating sliders and buttons, using callback functions instead of the preload functions (which we also learned in CC1). I also learned about how to loop, play, stop and pause sounds. Particularly important was the information about important libraries like _p5.js_, _p5.dom.js_ and _p5.sound.js_. Complementary to this I also learned about functions luke jump(), duration(), addCue() and currentTime(), which I found very important for my project. In addition, I was able to identify and work with the information of the amplitude of the sound, different play modes and even how to create sound synthesis with p5 along with ADSR envelopes. Finally I became aware of the possibilities of using microphone's input, the visualization of sound and the FFT - Frequency analysis. 

* After having gained knowledge about p5 and sound on p5 I decided to learned about Arduino. I found a [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0beHPVMklwhUxv_DNJ31M5BVrp6Y4SX4) about physical computing, which was not very good. I think Patt Vira, the person behind the series is very talented, but the 3 videos of the series are too basic and are not what she promised at the beginning of the series. In her defence I will say that she started this series 3 months ago and probably in the future she will be able to really explain the connection between arduino and p5, which she hasn't done so far. I had the change to go to the physical computing workshop at the Filmuni this semester and this videos were unfortunately lake a 5% of the workshop we had. I will look for other tutorials that could help me with this part of the project. Here is a screenshot: 


    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/de22af2028c0c110943c6d409a44b76a2e4de4cd/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/03_Arduino_Patt%20Vira.png)

* Joel Schaefer from CTECH made a tutorial about motion tracking, that he shared with me: It is called [_"Finger Tracking for Audiovisual Application (LeapMotion + TouchDesigner + Ableton)"_](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/workshop_wi2324_ti/tree/main/Submissions/Schaefer). 

    I learned that you must install the tracking software of the Leap device, Touchdesigner and Ableton and the workflow in order to make the movement of the fingers and hands create variations of sound and sound effects. Particularly interesting for me was the use of samples. I have never worked with Ableton, but it looks like a great tool. I will try now to build my own workflow with p5 and Arduino to achieve something similar.  
    
    SOmething that Joel pointed out, that I find very important is to find an Open Sound Control (OSC) connection between the DAW and the software. I will look for a way to connect Reaper with p5 and Arduino. 

* I found [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqQgxgnH9wg) very good to understand the sensor I have and the way I can connect it to the Arduino micro controller. I was very happy to discover that the HR - SR04 Ultrasonic sensor I am working with is very good to measure distances. According to Rachel, the tutorial teacher, this sensor is much better than a regular motion sensor like the PIR sensor (passive infrared), because is more nuanced. This means, that it is possible to program different events to be triggers at different distances. It uses echolocation to find out how far objects are. It has 2 transducers, one that transmits ultrasonic pulses (T) and another one that receives it (R)

    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/8d3b6582a0962fcc62465e13074cb4c7d0bbf8a8/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/04_%20Ultrasonic%20Sensor.png)

* Rachel, the same person who did the previous tutorial also  made [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/ybhMIy9LWFg?si=SIbH8jf4wTOEkhsM) where she uses the ultrasonic sensor to control a Servo. I liked the way se explains and I learned how to apply the map() function to connect different devices.

    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/dae269f94b3acece46aa0efb881d6ef23dfbb5f8/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/05_%20Ultrasonic%20Sensor%20_%20map.png)

    At this point and following both Tutorials of Rachel I was able to write my code for Arduino: 
    
    >const int trigPin = 9;
    >
    >const int echoPin = 10;
    >
    >float duration;
    >
    >float distanceCM; // in centimeters
    >
    >
    >void setup() {
    >
    >  Serial.begin(9600); //establishes serial communication between your Arduino board and the computer.
    >
    >  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
    >
    >  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
    >
    >}
    >
    >void loop() {
    >
    >//start with a clean signal
    >
    >  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
    >
    >  delayMicroseconds(2);
    >
    >//send trigger signal
    >
    >  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
    >
    >  delayMicroseconds(10);
    >
    >  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
    >
    >//return pulse duration in microseconds
    >
    >//if set to HIGH; pulseIn() waits for the pin to go from LOW to HIGH
    >
    >// stops timing when pin goes back LOW
    >
    >  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
    >
    >//convert m/s (of speed of sound) to in/microsec
    >
    >//343 m/s = 0.034 com/microseconds
    >
    >  distanceCM = (duration * 0.034) / 2;
    >
    >// print distance
    >
    >  // Serial.print("Distance: ");
    >
    >  Serial.println(distanceCM);
    >
    >  // Serial.println("cm");
    >
    >  delay(100); //to slow down the readings to read better
    >
    >}
    >

* I found what I was looking for! A way to connect arduino and p5. I found [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/MtO1nDoM41Y?si=cuyPiSBj3mmTh_Q8) where I learned that a program is needed to allow Javascript in the browser to access the serial ports of my computer. It is a JS App called _"**p5.serialcontrol**"_ Here is a screenshot: 

    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/ab06dc57442c39f405cebbf041243d88d037eac3/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/06_%20connection%20p5_arduino%20and%20sensor.png)

* I tried to follow the tutorial, but I got an error on the p5.serialcontrol, even though everything looks good on the Arduino software: 
   
    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/f012a27f1be0e3862dfefcb569b2ae6a4a8291c1/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/07_%20error%20p5%20serialcontrol.png)

* I thought the error was because the tutorial I saw was made using MAC, so I watched [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/MHJ6KpgE7j4?si=z0MKOeLMro4rJOvZ) since it was made using Windows. But I discovered that I should not have errors, because the person from the tutorial did not have any issues. I really recommend this tutorial, it helped me understand how to connect the arduino with p5 better. For example, it is very important to write on the html file the **_p5.serialcontrol.js_** library in order to complete the connection. Not only the software is required to do so. 
    
    This is what I wrote on the HTML file of my p5 sketch to add the library of p5.serialcontrol, based on this tutorial: 

    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/7ff48cbc731721c2f664f084275d8275a85d0db7/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/09_paste%20code%20in%20the%20html.png)

* I was able to solve the error by closing the Arduino software and work with the p5.serialcontrol. It seems like since both programs want to get the information that the sensor is receiving, but it can only be read in one of the softwares at the time, at least in my case. 
    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/80f06a040bba4051b09e4c861d51bade3306fb82/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/08_solved%20error.png) 

    As you can see on the picture, Arduino gets the error now but I still get the information of the sensor where I really need: p5.serialcontrol.

* I want to use the measured distance of the sensor as the defining element of the volume of one of the sound samples on p5.   On the p5 web editor, in addition to what I already have, I uploaded 2 sounds. To do so I clicked on the "+" and I uploaded the sound file. p5 will only let you upload a maximum of 5mb, so make sure the files are not bigger than that.

    I got the sound files from  https://www.freesound.org and since it was bigger than 5mb I used this website to compress it: https://www.onlineconverter.com/compress-mp3 it is now 3.5mb.  Here is the information of the author: _Atmospheric Landscape for Meditation Relaxation and Yoga by Muyo5438 -- freesound.org/s/718704/ -- License: Attribution 4.0_. This first sound will be static and be used as a "base", while the second one (ocean waves) will be louder or quieter according to the distance read by the sensor. I will also use the data of the sensor to draw circles with a size that depends on how far the person is to the sensor.

* At this point I thought I had everything ready, I was even having data flowing from the sensor, to the Arduino software, to the p5.serialcontrol to my p5 sketch in my browser. I could see the changing values of the distance on the serial console of the p5.serialcontrol and on the console of my p5 sketch. However, when I was trying to use the variable that has all the values of the distance changes "reported" by the sensor p5 would tell me that it was "undefined". I tried different solutions and I rewatched the tutorials trying to find an answer. I tried to solve it myself and I could not understand what the problem was. I decided to ask ChatGPT at this point, not only to have an answer, but also to ask it to explain to me what I have done wrong. 

    This was the original code I had on my p5 sketch: 

     > let song; 
     >
     >let serial;
     >
     >let latestData;
     >
     >let newVol;
    >
    > function preload(){
    >
    >song = loadSound('718704-muyo5438-atmospheric-land.mp3')
    >
    >}
    >
    >
    >function setup() {
    >
    >createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
    >
    >serial = new p5.SerialPort();
    >
    >serial.open("COM5");
    >
    >serial.on("data", gotData);
    >
    >song.play();
    >
    >// map the distance (CM) to the volume of the sound. Closer is quiter and farther is lauder. 
    >
    >let newVol = map(latestData,5,200,0, 1);
    >
    >let col = map(latestData,5, 200, 0, 255);
    >
    >}
    >
    >function draw() {
    >
    >background(latestData);
    >
    >song.setVolume(newVol);
    >}
    >
    >function gotData() {
    >
    >let currentString = serial.readLine();
    >
    >trim(currentString);
    >
    >if (!currentString) return;
    >
    >latestData = parseInt(currentString);   // Update latestData with parsed sensor value
    >
    >console.log(latestData); // Debugging line
    >
    >}
    >

    I asked chatGPT and my problem was the order. I learned 2 important things: 
    1) I was trying to use the "latestData" variable in setup along with a map() function ir order to adjust the ranges of the background color and the sound volume, but since that variable depends on the callback function "gotData" and the programming model of Javascript is asynchronous, I was calling a function that was not ready to deliver the information about the values of the sensor. I moved the map functions and the "latestData" variable to draw() so the gotData callback function can be ready to deliver the information I need when draw() updates. 
    2) I learned from ChatGPT that I can use "(latestData !== undefined)" as a condition on my draw() function to ensure that "latestData" has a valid value before using it as a vavalid variable in the map() functions.

    The working code is:

* I took this chance and used this experiments to do the assignment for _**Technology Introductions**_ and I did a tutorial that it is available [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIcMXxjI=/?share_link_id=450052392297) where it is possible to see my partial results until now.  The final version of my p5 sketch is available [here](https://editor.p5js.org/dlpp/sketches/Xm-Me1geI). 

    The video with the results that is also available on my tutorial is here:
  
[![Tutorial: Sensors + Arduino + p5 = Interactive artistic tool!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/XZovjXTPFMI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZovjXTPFMI "Tutorial: Sensors + Arduino + p5 = Interactive artistic tool!") 


* On this iteration process I wanted to get closer to nature, since I am working with a Ceiba Forest for my Orientierungsprojekt. I want to fusion my new discoveries. That is the reason why I decided to watch a series of p5 coding called _"[Algorithmic Botany](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bxNsa_3SfCPyF9Md9XvXhR)"_ by "The coding train": 

    Here is a screenshot:

    ![alt text](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/9650592e31875df946ffb4e17d88aaf958f2ea7c/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/10_Botany.png)


    In this series I learned different ways in which one can generate trees and fractal forms. The 3 tutorials that I liked the most where:
    * The one about "Barnsley Fern", because it brings together the mathematical calculations of nature and the functions that researchers have defined in order to understand the "logic" of nature. When using those functions and adjust the proven probability of those patterns we can create wonderful natural forms.  

    * The one about "phyllotaxis", the spirals that form a distinctive class of patterns in nature. _phýllon_ means leave and _táxis_ means arrangement both in ancient greek. FOr this it is necessary to transform the polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates. Similar to the Barnsley Fern, this tutorial takes a mathematical information and uses it as a creative tool. 

    * The third one was veeeeery long (more than 3 hours), it was a live recording and the last video of that tutorial. The Professor shows how he implements a physics library on his sketch. THe library is called _Toxiclibs.js_ and the worked with recursion, when an object or function is being defined by itself, with particles and with springs. This vas very advanced for me, but it gave me an idea on how to work with physics when programming. It was also interesting to see how the professor was struggling, finding solutions to the problems that came up in order to train the algorithmic thinking and get an idea on how to create a virtual world with similar physic rules.  


* After those results I saw this tutorial. It explains the possibilities of audio using Arduino. It is possible to create your own controllers. I learned that it is possible to create an oscillator with a piezo and the Arduino board. I did not have a box like the one on the tutorial so I was able to achieve the same result, but I will share in a moment a video that I found better. 

    [![Arduino and Audio: Getting Started | Simon Hutchinson](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wQHBhNeiH18/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQHBhNeiH18 "Arduino and Audio: Getting Started | Simon Hutchinson")

    The creator of the video recommended this book: 
    ![alt text](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-oxPiSq0L._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)
    Specially the chapter of  _Joseph Kramer_ called "Microcontroller sound", which I really want to check out if not now for my future explorations. 

* I wanted to learn more about Piezo sensors so I watched this video, but I do not recommend it, the next one is THE ONE to understand. [![APiezo sensor with Arduino UNO - How does work Piezo sensor (Code and Circuit Diagram)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wMjCMAXF9CI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMjCMAXF9CI "Piezo sensor with Arduino UNO - How does work Piezo sensor (Code and Circuit Diagram)")


* This is a SOOO MUCH better video about the piezo and how to use it. I learned that they can be used as an input module and as an output module. **Very good and on point tutorial** by the way.

    [![Arduino and Audio: Getting Started | Simon Hutchinson](https://img.youtube.com/vi/sqHJ9tDC9IM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqHJ9tDC9IM "Arduino and Audio: Getting Started | Simon Hutchinson")

* After understanding better about the way piezos work I wanted to understand better the different types of audio modules for electronics project. I watched this video: 

     [![Audio modules for electronics project](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8obcTTYtjQM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8obcTTYtjQMM "Audio modules for electronics project")

     I could understand better the different audio modules available and their characteristics.
     - **DF player mini mp3 player** 3 modes, it has an amplifier. 
     - **Catalex serial mp3 player** no amplifier, no stand-alone device. it has a resistor and a capacitor. 
     -  **DY-SV17F**  It has a build-in capacitor and an amplifier. it has only 4mb flash memory (not much. )
     - **DY-SV5W** (SD card slot, up to 32 Gb and probably _the **best option for my project**_) and **DY-SV8F** (flash memory 8mb) = both have 5 Watt amplifier, playing modes are selected on the modules. 
     - **DY-HV20T** and **DY-HV8F** = they can be way louder 20Watt amplifier

     Additionally the creator suggests to use te audacity software to normalize it, trim the silence and export. The files on the SD card will be played in the order they were added to the SD card. There is a program called **drive sort** that helps to organize the order of the files. 

     There is also a Dyplayer repository on Github for more information. 


* I started to realize the importance of knowing the different kinds of sensors to decide how to build my project. There are A LOT! so I started with 4 videos made during the pandemic about sensors which help to avoid contact. The code used by the creator is run on the **Arduino software**. Those are: 
    - Infrared obstacle avoidance sensor: It is an optical system, depends on the reflectivity of the color/object but **it does not work with black objects.**
   
    [![Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Tutorial for Arduino / ESP32](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y6sGoqSujlQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6sGoqSujlQ "Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Tutorial for Arduino / ESP32")

    - The ultrasonic range sensor: I already know this one but I learned that a library is necessary in Arduino software to use this one called "svc/Ultrasonic.h". A low and a max distance can be decided, I found that very useful. 
    [![Ultrasonic Range Sensor Touch-Free Input Tutorial for Arduino / ESP32](https://img.youtube.com/vi/y1DzkSryUVQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1DzkSryUVQ "Ultrasonic Range Sensor Touch-Free Input Tutorial for Arduino / ESP32")

    - Laser time of flight sensor: It is more acurate but more expensive. It need 2 libraries: "<wire.h>" and "svc/Adafruit_vls3lox"
    [![Arduino Laser Time-of-Flight Sensor Touch-Free Input Tutorial / ESP32](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VnSfw9ynemc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnSfw9ynemc "Arduino Laser Time-of-Flight Sensor Touch-Free Input Tutorial")

    - Finally we have the capacitive sensor: It works with the capacitance, the ability to hold electrical charge. HUman skin is made from water and the water and air have difference in capacitance so we can change the capacitance of a pin. **I would like to run some test with this kind of sensor.** In contrast to the other 3 sensors previously described this does not need any kind of line of sight, there is no emitted signal that bounces back. **I can cover the sensor (hide it) and it will work.** 

         [![Arduino Capacitive Touch-Free Touch Sensor Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AvMYqBj6CSg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMYqBj6CSg "Arduino Capacitive Touch-Free Touch Sensor Tutorial")

* I continued learning about sensors and I found this video:

     [![Sensors - which one to use](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DlG6LY84MUU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlG6LY84MUU "Sensors - which one to use")

    - **PIR sensor:** Passive infrared sensor. Detects radiation changes. Movement. 
    - **Color sensor - TCS3200 chip**
    - **Heart pole sensor:** Optical heart sensor + amplification and noise cancellation. **I want to run test with this one**
    - **Infrared distance sensor** -  analogue input. 
    - **Infrared obstacle avoidance:** (already mentioned above)
    - **Laser based distance sensor:** (already mentioned above)
    - **LDR (light dependent resistor):** it changes its value according to the amount of light that receives. 
    - **IMO Module (APO 6050 - APO 9265).** It senses gyro forces and accelerations. It can be used with drones that must fly horizontal. 
    - **Magnetometer:** HMC 5883 they detect / measure the earth magnetic field. 
    - **Atmospheric pressure sensor:** to measure the altitude. 
    - **Gas sensor:** air gases, air quality and alcohol. 
    - **Ultrasonic sensor** (already mentioned, twice!)
    - **Thermo couple voltage sensor:** small voltage drop when heated up. it needs amplifier. 
    - **Thermistor:** temperature dependent resistor. Similar to the previous one. 
    - **Current sensor.** 
    - **Magnetic field sensor:** interacts with magnets.


* I also saw a video about 3 ways of playing audio on Arduino **using the software of Arduino to run the code**: 
    [![3 Options for Playing Audio on Arduino](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UN9XPWHamHw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN9XPWHamHw "3 Options for Playing Audio on Arduino)")

    - **Option 1:** it is only for tones, no files, so it does not work for me. 
    - **Option 2:** It has a button and 1 file. It uses a greeting card module. It does not work for me. 
    - **Option 3:** this option uses an sd card module, external amplifiers and it is possible to have multiple songs. **this is the option that can work for me**

* I saw this video and learned about the 2 types of buzzers: active and passive. The first one can play only 1 tone, while the latter can play different tones.
   
    [![How to Use Buzzers (Active and Passive) with an Arduino (Lesson #20)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/gj-H_agfd6U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj-H_agfd6U "How to Use Buzzers (Active and Passive) with an Arduino (Lesson #20)")


* Looking for videos I found that some persons even teach how to play the Super Mario song with arduino and a piezo buzzer. 
    [![Super Mario music using arduino and piezo buzzer (with code)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/D4yeomu333E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4yeomu333E "Super Mario music using arduino and piezo buzzer (with code)")

* After all this input I wondered how to work simultaneously with different sensors and one Arduino, so I saw this two videos, but they were not useful for me: 
    - The first one is about using Multiple Sensors with 1 Arduino, but all those sensors are different and the tutorial only shows how they can light a led, so I need to keep looking for more complex systems as an example. 
     [![Using Multiple Sensors with 1 Arduino- Tutorial ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fsy5X1b6WuY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsy5X1b6WuY "Using Multiple Sensors with 1 Arduino- Tutorial ")

     - The second one is about giving the Arduino different tasks with the millis() function. I am not sure this is what I need for my project. 
     [![How to do multiple tasks in Arduino | Beginners | millis() function ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ol6x5mjeu4w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol6x5mjeu4w "How to do multiple tasks in Arduino | Beginners | millis() function ")

*  The last step of my exploration was the body recognition. I saw this tutorial and learned how to make it work. However, as you will read later, I went with hand recognition, which was already described in the results.
 [![Pose Estimation with ml5.js](https://img.youtube.com/vi/T99fNXTUUaQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T99fNXTUUaQ "Pose Estimation with ml5.js")



### **EXPLAIN WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES ARE PART OF YOUR RESULTS AND HOW SO**
* **Creative / artistic development:** 
    My creative approaches started in the traditional audiovisual media: Film and Television made in sets. Those audiovisual experiences were meant to be seen on a screen, without any demands being made on the audience. With the time I got closer to experiments and narratives that go beyond the traditional scope, so I got interested in video art and expanded cinema. Now I am learning how to create interactive and immersive experiences that can bring us closer to the nature and that can arise awareness on the importance of being active in the interaction of art and in the creation of the world we live in.

    _The Ceiba forest_ is without doubt the outcome of an ongoing learning process on how to transform the audiovisual from a passive to an active experience, in which the audience is triggering elements of the installation thought the movement and physical interaction of the installation space - time that can bring us closer to the nature and that can arise awareness on the importance of being active in the interaction of art and in the creation of the world we live in. Art can and should be more than a contemplative experience and I am developing a way of expressing myself through artworks that are alive and in a dialogue with the audience and therefore are constantly evolving. 

    My sound exploration is based on a series of samples that are not already linearly organized, but instead they are arranged in a collection from which they are randomly played by the interaction of the audience with the sensors. The order is not pre-established and the landscape is created spontaneously and in real time, replacing the principle of the traditional pre-established order of cinema and television. The visual on the other hand reflects the degree of live present on the ecosystem, which increases with the interactions of the public. 

* **Narrative development:**  
    There is a separation between the human and the non - human due to the anthropocentrism of the occidental culture we live in. Nature is normally considered a medium, but not an actor, so we create audiovisual experiences for humans where all the elements are objects that are in the background. I believe we can create narratives where the human elements are not prioritized but are as important as the non-human elements. 

    The forest is a complex network of living organisms and the technology is a human extension. My work is born in the narrative and aesthetic exploration of the possibilities of the reconnection of the human and the non-human, where synchronism and asynchronism coexist. WHile the sounds and the visuals are showcased in response to the movement and gestures of the audience, the experience unfolds in an unexpected way, creating a space of possibilities. 

    The implications of the active role of the audience in my work can be described On the one hand as the possibility of experiencing the audiovisual as a living organism that changes and responds to the audience. Nature is a subject instead of an object, which gives rise to narratives based on the interaction of the forest and the humans. On the other hand the artwork is not ready to be shown, but instead demands the action of the audience in order to be displayed and evolve. 

     I aim to create narratives where people can be conscious about their potential in having a positive impact in the world while reconnecting with the nature in other ways. I hope that the interaction with this installation can lead to reflection and awareness. 

* **Audio-visual design:**
The way we relate to the audiovisual can be questioned and this installation aims to offer a space for experimentation of new possibilities of observing, listening and interacting with the audiovisual elements and the nature. I bet on an audiovisual experience where the elements can be deconstructed and re-signified through the expansion of the installation space-time with the inclusion of natural elements. The complexity of the relationships between living organisms can be showcased with complexity and not linearity and that expands naturally the traditional ways of experiencing the audiovisual. The source of the inspiration for innovative audiovisual experiences can be found in the nature and in the way the communication exists in that context between other living organisms that surround us.

* **Research / Experimentation:** This has been a very enriching path, where I have been able to question and re significate the way in which the audiovisual is created. Art, technology and nature are definitely compatible with the expansion of the limits of the art realm. The interdisciplinary approach gives art the agency to experiment, create and even protect the world we live in by raising awareness and appealing to the importance of the action of the audience inside and outside the context of the installation in order to experiment a beautiful healthy environment. 

* **Software, Hardware and pipeline development + Algorithms:** are means to an end and correspond to my learning path to focus on the other categories I already explained. 



### **REFLECTION OF TECHNICAL CHOICES**
* **Why did you make the choice you made?:** The concept I developed was my compass, even though I did not always know what to do in order to move forward with the project. The intuition and continuous search were very important for the process. I decided to use p5 as the central software tool in order to simplify the process, because using different softwares in the workflow could affect the performance. For the hardware I chose the ultrasonic sensor and the DIY capacitance sensor because they are cheap and very effective in comparison to the other sensors and posibilities. I also included the hand recognition instead of the body pose recognition because I want the interaction of the audiente with the tree to be close and the points of the hand can be read easily when the audience is close to the camera, while the body points will need some distance in order to be read. 

* **What worked well, what didn't?:** At the beginnig I thought the gamification would be central in the building of the storytelling when talking about difficult issues like the droughts of the Amazonas and the global warming. However, I realised that the gamification was not adding to the project, or at least not in the way I thought. Studing the nature was way more enriching because the (for the human eye) invisible dynamics of the forest showed me a more organic way of designing the communication between the audience and the instalation. The notion of chance in the creation of music and the challenging artistic proposals for installations, games are way more connected to the dinamics of the nature that I leanred in this process and it made everything more organic and cohesive. 

* **What would you do differently next time?:** I am very proud of my process, it was very intuitive and that made me feel comfortable taking into account that I have been learning something I did not know before. There are things that I want to do to expand the project, but I have no regrets. 

### **REFLECTION ON YOUR MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT AND BEST-CASE SCENARIO PLANS**
* **What did you archive, what not and why?:** I was able to do my baseline solution and I had progress on the best possible solution. I developed a concept for the sound and visual interaction after learning and experimenting with different approaches. I implemented sensors, hand recognition and a responsive sound system that is triggered by the audience. I was able to work on the 3 different stages of the installation with the sound (the footsteps, the rain, the water, the fullness or hollowness of the tree, the closeness of the animals) and also implement a first visual proposal that react to the movement and closeness of the audience to the tree. 

    Since my iterations with the sensors and the interactive sound system where long I was not able to test materials for the scenographie. I decided to focus in what I did not know what to do and the Szenographie and the light design is something that I would like to develop next semester to bring this installation to life. 


### **CHALLENGE OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE**
* **What was new for you, and what did you learn?:** Almost everything was new for me. I learned a lot about the importance of the forest and the way in which the trees autoregulate themselves and are connected to the others through other living organism like fungi, bacterias and animals. It was also very insightful to understand better the impact of climate change on this ecosystems. The communication system inside this ecosystem is very complex and special and it was very inspiring to learn about it. 

    On the other hand, I learned about a lot of different microprocessors and sensors and the ways and possibilities that they offer. Not the most expensive or precise sensor is the one that can do the job. It really depends on the proyect. There are so many persons online talking and explaining this dynamics, but I think it is also very important to take notes and to identify the persons who have a talent to teach in order to move the project forward. 

    I also learned that the interaction systems that exist in the nature are a very good source of inspiration for the artificial interaction systems that we can build to communicate with the non - human, because those dynamics are not visible or audible but are effective and a very good example for us. 

* **What was the most difficult for you?:** On the one hand the simplification of the interaction system in order to enhance the performance and on the other hand to find the right sensors for the project. To work with different sensors and hand recognition in order to have an influence on the audiovisual output of the artwork was very challenging, since I did not even have previous experience with different types of sensors or with interactive systems. As you can see on my results, I am still learning how to connect everything in a single autonomous system that can have a smooth transition between the 3 stages of the installation. 

### **REFLECTION ON YOUR ORIGINAL WORK PLAN WITH TIMELINE**
* **Did you follow your plan and if not, why not?:** The timeline changed a lot, since I could not work with the body recognition and the selection of the sound samples until the end, since the search for the best sensor took me way more time than I thought and I got responsive audiovisual output earlier than I thought. In the end I was able to learn what I needed to learn to develop the minimal viable product and move forward in the best possible scenario. 



## **SOURCE FILES**
_**Please note**_ that you will be able to see the results only on the presentation day in April, since they depend on the interaction with the sensors I have plugged in my computer. 

### "**THE WATER SYSTEM**":
The hand recognition system is based on [this code](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/o5wnL6esQ)

### "**THE SOIL SYSTEM**":
The sounds that will be played randomly are in [this folder](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/9H8o5jCJLulEfZX)

### "**THE AIR SYSTEM**": 

As I already mentioned this was my final project for CC1, here is the diagram of the data flow: 

![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/489a021e4538fc3b338264407f4c56b6d03ae70f/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img%20Final/13_Diagramm.png)

Only some of the parts of the project will be online, like the 2 final p5 sketches, where you will be able to see my final coding results. Since I am working with an Ultrasonic sensor and the artworks depend on that interaction, the audiovisual components of the project will be shown in this document with pictures, videos and text.

These are the links of both sketches on p5: 

1. This one is called [**_CC1_Final_Barnsley Fern_**](https://editor.p5js.org/dlpp/sketches/ifUgqlkzA)

2. This one is called [**_CC1_Final_Phyllotaxis_**](https://editor.p5js.org/dlpp/sketches/dYxbOPON-)

On both codes you can find information about the authors of the sounds. 

As you already saw earlier in this iteration my project consist of the data flow of an ultrasonic sensor through the arduino software, a "bridge software" called p5.serialcontrol and 2 p5 sketches on the web editor.

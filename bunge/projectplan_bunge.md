# Project Plan Orientationproject 

*Submission 15.01.25*

## 1. Motivation:
My motivations come from two main factors for this project. First, I am very interested in Human and Computer Interactions (HCI). I like to explore how users interact with digital systems, not just functionally, but emotionally and behaviorally. HCI provides a fascinating lens to understand how technology shapes our experiences, influences our decisions, and even alters our perceptions of ourselves and the world around us. I am particularly drawn to the subtle ways digital environments and interfaces can evoke emotions, foster engagement, and create a sense of connection or disconnection.
Second, and this is the reason why I changed my original idea, which was presented during the application interviews, is that I wanted to learn something new and go away from my comfort zone. Especially, I was very interested in the program TouchDesigner which I have seen so many cool ways to use for different goals, this versatility of the program is what caught me and told me to learn this program. 
By combining my interest in Human-Computer Interaction with my desire to master TouchDesigner, this project becomes a unique opportunity for me. It allows me to investigate how users perceive and connect with digital representations while learning a new medium that challenges my previous design and coding skills.. 

## 2.	Project Details: 

**Research Question (Guide Question):**
How does the visual representation of emotions strengthen the relationship between users and their digital representations?


### a.	Description:
There are different ways of digital self-representation. For example, Instagram Profiles usually showcase our own “best” side or when creating an avatar we try to aim for features we also would like to have (e.g. dyed hair, height, strength, etc). 
People like to present themselves in the digital world in different forms and there are different ways to do that. People use these digital representations how they would like the world to perceive them. They shape and customize them, mostly showing their "best" side. On this path of digitally representing themselves, people develop a relationship with these representations. They feel attached to them... of course, they are in a way "them". In these cases, they are digital representations that are more directly related to the user (Instagram) and others where the relationship connection is not that obvious at first sight (Game Characters).
Another topic I want to touch on is intelligent chatbots. For an instance, the app “Replika” is trying to replicate its users. The company “Luka” developed an intelligent chatbot that allows users to create a digital version of themselves. Replika manages this by “chatting” with them, gathering information on them, and becoming more and more tailored to each user. The company stated that its goal is for Replika to act like the user in such a way that it can even become a personalized assistant that helps the user with day-to-day activities. 

There have even been some cases in which people want to marry or fall in love with digital characters and intelligent assistants. This is a clear case where digital avatars can become a great help and/or a big influence on users' behavior. 
Before diving into the details of my concept, I want to provide an overview of the fields that inspire and shape my project. These fields revolve around three core themes: influence, emotions, and relationships.
Influence: In the digital age, our interactions with technology go beyond mere functionality. Digital avatars, chatbots, and systems subtly influence how we think, feel, and behave.
Emotions: Why focus on emotions? For me, emotions provide a direct and insightful path to uncovering the influence. By tapping into emotional responses, we can observe how digital representations affect users in a very straightforward way. 

**Hypothesis:**
The visual representation of emotions in digital avatars strengthens the relationship between users and their digital representations by increasing emotional engagement and influencing users' emotions and behaviors over time. (e.g., becoming calmer when the avatar is calm)

**Methodology**

There is gonna be a first part of research and insights gathering of research papers and discussions about how relationships between users and their avatars are built. These are the main fields I am focusing on: Influence, Relationships and Emotions. 
These insights will help to produce the first round of interview questions. 

Interviews - Round 01: <br>
Semi-Structured interviews with the three test subjects will be conducted. Here I want to find out, their experiences witht their digital representations, how they think and feel about it. I want to find out whats the most important for them when creating a digital representation. 

Testing: <br>
The same subjects are being tested in different scenarios and have to follow a given task. At the end of the tests, the subjects will be informed in more detail about what the goals of these tests were.

Interviews - Round 02: <br>
The final round of interviews is probably the most interesting part. These interviews will be structured and have a clear guidelines to analyze the results and compare them with each other. Here, I want to focus on their thoughts and experiences during the interview. What they think the outcomes will be and if they felt the influence in any way. Also, their thoughts about what could be improved for another experiment. 

Analysis: <br>
This part is still in discussion with my mentor on how to analyze the results. However, here as for the answers to the second interview as for the results of the emotion data will be analyzed. 

### b.	Categorization: 

**Research / Experimentation:**

The planned outcome of this project seeks to address significant gaps in the research regarding how individuals are influenced by avatars or other digital representations, while also integrating emotions as a visible and measurable method to analyze this influence.

### d.	Unique Selling Point: 

The unique selling point of this project lies in its innovative exploration of how emotional visualizations in digital avatars influence user engagement and behavior. By combining Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with the creative potential of TouchDesigner, the project not only investigates the emotional relationships users develop with their digital representations but also pioneers a new approach to measuring and understanding these connections (how much is the impact).


## 3.	Expected Results

Most fears tingle around the emotion recognition system. As for now, there is still hope written in the stars. I am working and testing different options and devices to achieve a makeable but also meaningful result. 

### a.	Baseline Solution

Nevertheless, if the worst comes, I am (emotionally) prepared. I started this project with the motivation of learning and exploring more about the relationship between human and Computer interactions. TouchDesigner is a great tool to generate such interactions and work with them for different goals. If my tests and/or devices in emotion recognition aren’t that great, I am happy with the literature research outcomes (knowledge) and the creation of user’ avatars that are interactive. 

### b.	Best Possible Solution

A new and very straightforward measurable way to detect the influence will start its baby steps. The user can customize their avatar to strongly relate to their digital representation. There is an emotional trigger (probably videos, pictures, and/or sound), so the user’s emotions are triggered. If that works well, I can collect the data of the tests and see if IF and HOW big the influence of the avatar is on the user’s emotions. 


## 4.	Vision and Future Work

The topic of relationships between users and their avatars is very interesting from my perspective. Future work could delve into the complex interplay between emotional interaction and user influence, critically examining how avatars shape not only self-perception but also behavior. Avatars that adapt to emotions or evolve with user input risk becoming tools of subtle manipulation, raising questions about and control. Nevertheless, avatars could become tools for self-expression, emotional exploration, and even storytelling, blurring the line between technology and humanity. Exploring their role in shared virtual spaces or as personalized companions must include a careful critique of how these systems might reinforce biases, create dependencies, or exploit emotional vulnerabilities.
What might this future work look like? Maybe a more artistic, exhibition environment approach would fit. Create a work for people to play with and learn about these kinds of subtle influences and their potential negative development. 

## 5.	Challenge Of Your Comfort Zone

Almost every part of this project feels bitter-sweet. I began with a strong focus on my learning journey, which led me to abandon my original idea presented in the application interviews. Instead, I pivoted to something entirely different—both in setup, planning, and the skill set required. It's a significant departure from the kind of projects I’ve tackled before in my design studies, and that shift gives me more motivation. Still, I am pretty sure, even though most of the skills I still need to learn, (for instance, TouchDesigner, measurement of outcomes, and dealing with new handwear) I will manage to have a good and satisfying result.

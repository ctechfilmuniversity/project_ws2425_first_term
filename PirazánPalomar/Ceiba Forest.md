## MOTIVATION: 

### **Personal Motivation**:
The Ceiba tree (Kapok tree) is a magnificent species originated in pre-Hispanic Latin America and present in different parts of the world which existence is of big benefit not only for itself, but also to other species and the ecosystem itself. It is a great example and inspiration for us humans on how to interact with our environment in a constructive way, rather than in a destructive one, as it is unfortunately the case until today. The Ceiba has helped its ecosystem, but now we are the ones who have to help the Ceiba to survive, since the rainforests are facing increasingly extreme droughts and uncontrollable forest fires. I am convinced that the installative experience can raise awareness on this issue and can be a call to action. 

### **Contextual Information:**
+ **About the _Ceiba_:**

  The Ceiba tree is on of the biggest trees in the tropical forests, it can be up to 70m tall.

    It is classified as pantropical, that means that is it present not only in the Americas, the continent I come from, but also in Africa and Asia. It is present in forest and in the jungle from Mexico to the south of the well known Amazonas region.

    It offers shelter thanks to the big shadow produced by its foliage and it provides food to bats, opossums, nocturnal monkeys, hummingbirds and moths thanks to its nectar filled flowers.

    Ceibas can store water in its trunk when the terrain is very wet. This water can be used later during the dry seasons by the Ceiba or shared with other surrounding trees.

    Moreover, this giant offers a soft cotton fiber, which cover the seeds of the tree, can travel long distances spreading the seed through air and can be used for other purposes like the fillings of the pillows. (See the picture below)

    This is how an old Ceiba looks like:

    All this characteristics have not been overlooked by indigenous peoples like Mayas and Ticunas. The former thought that due to the long roots of the tree and the branches, the tree was able to connect the underworld, the earth and the sky, shaping the world. Life then, flows world through this tree and its eradication would only mean the eradication of the world itself. The latter said that the end of the darkness of the world and the origin of the biggest river of Colombia, the Magdalena river, was the result of the felling of a big ceiba, which had plunged the world into thick darkness. This was possible thanks to two heroes: Yoi and Ipi together with the animals of the jungle.  Thus, the Ceiba is the origin of life and sacred being that keeps the world in order and balance.

    _**“Light Harps”**_ is an installation where a piano was made with lasers that get activated to the touch. _Jen Lewin_ is an US-American artist and engineer who works with light, sound and public interactive art. I really like this work, since people can play music together by touching the lasers. This is a reference for the interactivity part of my project.

    _**“Sanctuary of the Unseen Forest”**_  it is a videoinstalacion made by _Marshmallow Laser Feast (MLF)._ This project shows a digital representation of the Ceiba in the Colombian rainforest. It aims to see beyond the human senses in order to be able to observe and be conscious about the way everything is connected and how life resides inside plants from a sacred and contemplative perspective. It was made with Lidar scanning & Photogrammetry Processes.

    _**“Breathing with the forest”**_, also from _Marshmallow Laser Feast (MLF)_, is another contemplation project of the colombian Amazonas. This team gather volumetric data and ambisonic field recordings as part of a digital preservation process for endangered ecosystems and the species of fragile biomes, as they define them. It was also made with the help of Lidar scanning & Photogrammetry Processes.

     Another interesting example made by  _MLF_ is the project _**“Forest Bathing: Lupuna”**_, commissioned by the _Thermengruppe Josef Wund_; where the audiovisual installative experience meets nature through wellness. The audiovisual material was made thanks to the use of Lidar scanning & Photogrammetry Processes.
     

## PROJECT DETAILS:
### **Description:**
![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/81bdaf71bee2c5bb2de40b6da8270b84b8c4808b/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/19_INstallation.png)

This installation recreates a forest in the middle of Amazonas, where the Ceiba is the only and most important being of that ecosystem. The installation displays a tropical rainforest located indoors with only one big central Ceiba tree and surrounding screens that will become more important as the experience progresses. In general terms the venue will smell and sound like a rainforest that will match with the light design of the space according to the narrative of the experience. At the beginning the central Ceiba is in a dry forest. The drought will diminish and the tree will start reviving as soon as the audience enters the ecosystem, since they will be the water that the tree needs to survive and start growing, blooming and being the shelter of animals, plants and allow the regeneration of the ecosystem again. Only by the action of the audience the artwork will reveal itself and the forest will start healing again. When the ecosystem has enough water again, it can even store water in its trunk and that will be the end of the experience. 

The audience is clearly a character with impact on the experience. And the experience will have 3 successive main stages that will gradually evolve:

![image alt](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/project_ws2425_first_term/blob/81bdaf71bee2c5bb2de40b6da8270b84b8c4808b/Piraz%C3%A1nPalomar/img/21_Videoinstallation.png)

1. **The dry forest:** The beginning of the experience, everything is dark, the color palette is black, gray and beige, the colors do not have much saturation or brightness. The floor will look dry. When walking on the space the sounds of the footsteps of the audience will be the same as when something wet comes in contact with something very hot mixed with trampled dry leaves and breaking branches. The sounds of the space will be only wind and when touching the trunk, this will emit a hollow sound, since there is nothing inside. Visually the space will be mostly dark and the trunk will not show signs of life. 

2. **The regeneration phase:** Starting from the ground (the floor, the roots and the base of the trunk) up to the canopy of the tree, the tree and the surrounding screens will start to light up by the means of translating the movement of the audience into a more vivid environment rich in color and sound, representing the revival of the Ceiba. The trunk will have the typical vertically crisscrossed light green lines of the Ceiba, which will be recreated with lights that will flow (light up) according to the interaction of the audience with the installation. The sound will include water flowing through the space, the footsteps will sound like when one is in mud, a little rain may be heard, along with some  animals that start to get closer to the environment. When touching the trunk or getting closer to it, it will sound like a flow that comes from the inside of it. 

3. **The Ceiba forest:** The audience, i. e. the water will have such a positive effect in the environment, that the internal flow of the water will be louder, the footsteps will sound like stepping in puddles, some heavy rains will also be part of the sound design along with closer and louder animal sounds. Since this tree has the ability of storing water in its trunk, the sound of the hollowness of the beginning will be completely replaced by fullness at this point. Visually the screens around the place, that will be so tall as the tree, will show the rainforest around, full of other Ceibas, along with other species of plants, trees and animals. 

### **Categorization:**
- _**Creative / artistic development:**_ 
 My creative approaches started in the traditional audiovisual media: Film and Television made in sets.  With the time I got closer to experiments and narratives that go beyond the traditional scope, so I got interested in video art and expanded cinema. Now, I am learning how to create interactive and immersive experiences that can bring us closer to the nature and that can arise awareness on the importance of being active in the interaction of art and in the creation of the world we live in.

 - _**Narrative development:**_ The intuition and the gamification can be part of the storytelling when talking about difficult issues like the droughts of the Amazonas and the global warming. I aim to create narratives where  people can be conscious about their potential in having a positive impact in the world while reconnecting with the nature in other ways. 
      
- _**Research / Experimentation:**_ I want to learn how other artists and persons from other disciplines approach to this topics and I would love to experiment with the ways in which art and technology can be part of the discussion, not only as a showcase medium, but also as  a way of learning and having agency. 

- _**Software, hardware and pipeline development. (+Algorithms):**_ are means to an end and correspond to my learning path to focus on the 3 cathegories I already explained.


### **System diagram / Technical Setup / Tech Stack:**
My main focus for the baseline solution is the sound interaction of the audience with the instalation through sensors. However, here I have a list of all the elements I can think of when imaging this installation: 
- Projectors
- Computers
- Sensors
- Contact microphones (for the audiovisual set up)
- Cameras (for the audiovisual set up)
- Arduinos
- Linar scanners & Photogrammetry processes. 

### **Unique selling point:**
- _**What makes the project special to you?**_
This project is special to me because it brings not only  	art and nature together, but also because it requires the action of the audience to be shown 	and experienced, as is the case with the Amazon, which can only continue to be diverse, 	wonderful and generous to the extent that we take action. The active role, the agency is 	encouraged and the 	artwork its something the audience needs to work for. 

- _**Are you addressing gaps in the literature or contemporary design challenges or current debates in the arts or society etc.?**_ In my experimentation and research I would love to address the agency of the audience in topics beyond the aesthetic enjoyment. I want to learn and be part of the discussion. Post colonialism is a topic I want to learn more about and also about the ways in which latinamerica and europe can create other narratives beyond the extraction discourse that has existed from the beginning.


## EXPECTED RESULTS:
### **Baseline solution:**
**_What is the smallest achievement you want to reach?_** In a nutshell: A raw prototype of the interactive sound interface of the installation with sensors and sound. I want to focus on those 2 aspects, since it corresponds to the most challenging part for me. 
- _**Interaction:**_ Research, experimentation and conceptualization of the interaction with the help of sensors. I am thinking on working with the body recognition function of p5, for example. 
- _**Sound:**_ I want to be able to create the 3 stages of the installation, specially with the progressive changes in the sound effects (the footsteps, the rain, the water, the fullness or hollowness of the tree, the closeness of the animals)#

    _In a nutshell:_ A raw prototype of the interactive sound interface of the installation with sensors and sound.


### **Best possible solution:** 
_**What would you like to achieve if everything goes according to plan?**_ 
I would also like to work on the the gradual ascent of the lights of the trunk as the ecosystem becomes more hydrated and an approach to possible materials for the tree and to the visual part of the floor, the canopy of the tree and the surrounding screens. In this best case scenario the interaction of the audience will also influence the visual part of the installation and not only the sound. Also if I am in the best solution I could even work on the material experimentarion of the scenography. 


## VISION AND FUTURE WORK:
_**What is your vision for the project beyond what you can achieve within the first term project requirements and time?**_  I want to find different venues where this installation can be experienced as means of raising awareness on the urgency of doing something to regenerate the Amazons. It would be very interesting to get closer to political, cultural and social discussions and also to enrich the experience with other visions of the regeneration of the rainforest from the point of view of the indigenous, the scientist and other artists. Technically and creatively I would love to work on the concept of getting in touch with the “voice” of the rainforest and to create.


## CHALLENGE OF MY COMFORT ZONE:
- _**What is new for you and what do you want to learn?**_ The interactive system and the 3D Audio design of the project are new for me and what I want to learn. Thematically I am learning about the regeneration of ecosystems and I want to integrate that knowledge into the project. 

- _**What do you expect to be the most difficult for you?**_ To connect the sound and visual part of the installation to an autonomous system that reacts to the audience actions, since I have never created a system with such complexity.


## WORKPLAN
- _**Until 5th of February:**_ I will experiment with sensors and will focus on the interaction using p5 and the body recognition.

- _**Until the end of February**_ I will select and work the samples of the instalation an will integrate them to the interactivity system. 

- _**Until 15th of March**_ I will work on the best case scenario if I have enought time. If not then I will use this time a buffer for the baseline.
